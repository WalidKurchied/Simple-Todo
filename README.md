## Todo App
### Mobile First Design and Typescript use.
This is not a full professional application. I created this project as a way for me to practice the use of **Typescript** and I used the create-react-app so I didnt pay attention to folder structure's etc however I did remove some of the unwanted files.

### What I could have done differently
- I could have used a controlled input field to make it easier to clear the text from the input after creating a todo. I could have also used a forwardRef which would have allowed me to pass the ref from the Todo component to the TodoInput and perform most of the actions from the Todo component such as getting the value of the input, setting focus and clearing the input.

###Installation
```yarn install``` 

followed by

```yarn start```

TODO: 
- Fix some typings 
- Clear the text of input when todo is created

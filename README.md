### Mobile First Design and Typescript use.
This is not a full professional application. I created this as a practice project using the create-react-app so didnt pay attention to folder structure's etc I just wanted to learn and use typescript and also impelment a mobile first design which I did. The app is not complete!.

Something's I could have done differently:
1- I could have used a controlled input field to make it easier to clear the text from the input after creating a todo. I could have also used a forwardRef which would have allowed me to pass the ref from the Todo component to the TodoInput and perform most of the actions from the Todo component such as getting the value of the input, setting focus and clearing the input.


TODO: 
- Fix some typings 
- Clear the text of input when todo is created
